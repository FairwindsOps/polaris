Fairwinds' Polaris keeps your clusters sailing smoothly. It runs a variety of checks to ensure that
Kubernetes pods and controllers are configured using best practices, helping you avoid
problems in the future. Polaris can be run in a few different modes:

Polaris can be run in three different modes:
* As a [dashboard](/dashboard), so you can audit what's running inside your cluster.
* As an [admission controller](/admission-controller), so you can automatically reject workloads that don't adhere to your organization's policies.
* As a [command-line utility](/infrastructure-as-code), so you can test local YAML files, e.g. as part of a CI/CD process.

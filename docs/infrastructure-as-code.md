Polaris can be used on the command line to audit local Kubernetes manifests stored in YAML files.
This is particularly helpful for running Polaris against your infrastructure-as-code as part of a
CI/CD pipeline. Use the available [command line flags](#running-in-a-ci-pipeline)
to cause CI/CD to fail if your Polaris score drops below a certain threshold, or if any danger-level issues arise.


## Install the CLI
To run Polaris against your YAML manifests, e.g. as part of a Continuous Integration process,
you'll need to install the CLI.

Binary releases can be downloaded from the [releases page](https://github.com/fairwindsops/polaris/releases)
or can be installed with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
```bash
brew tap FairwindsOps/tap
brew install FairwindsOps/tap/polaris
polaris version
```

## Running in a CI pipeline
You can tell the CLI to set an exit code if it detects certain issues with your
YAML files.
For example, to fail if polaris detects *any* danger-level issues, or if the score drops below 90%:
```bash
polaris audit --audit-path ./deploy/ \
  --set-exit-code-on-danger \
  --set-exit-code-below-score 90
```

### As Github Action
#### Setup polaris action

This action downloads a version of [polaris](https://github.com/FairwindsOps/polaris) and adds it to the path. It makes the [polaris cli](https://polaris.docs.fairwinds.com/infrastructure-as-code) ready to use in following steps of the same job.

##### Inputs

###### `version`

The release version to fetch. This has to be in the form `<tag_name>`.

##### Outputs

###### `version`

The version number of the release tag.

##### Example usage

```yaml
uses: fairwindsops/polaris@master
with:
  version: "3.0.3"
```

Example inside a job:

```yaml
steps:
  - uses: actions/checkout@v2
  - name: Setup polaris
    uses: fairwindsops/polaris@master
    with:
      version: 3.0.3

  - name: Use command
